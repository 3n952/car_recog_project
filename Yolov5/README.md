# Car Object Detection with YOLOv5 model

### YOLOv5 is from  <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5">HERE</a>.  
To classify car model, we first have to detect car object. (Not classify the inter class, just car)  

So that we use YOLOv5 model to detect car object for our custom datasets. (train and infer)  
To train and infer using YOLOv5, please check official YOLOv5 repo and tutorials.  
This repo is required preprocessing to train YOLOv5 for Car detection.
